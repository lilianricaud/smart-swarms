Self-organization in Communicating Groups:the emergence of coordination, shared references and collectiveintelligence

After discussing many examples of successful and less successful cognitive coordination, Surowiecki proposes the following list of requirements that a group must fulfil to exhibit collective intelligence (or wisdom of crowds, as he calls it):•	Diversity: the more diverse the knowledge and experience possessed by the different members of the group, the more the group as whole knows and the less its members are likely to overlook certain aspects, or to fall prey to the same bias.• Independence: individuals should express their contribution as much as possible independently from other members of the group; otherwise, when the opinion of the one is influenced by the opinion of the other, there is a risk of premature alignment, i.e. between the contributions themselves rather than between the targets of the contributions.•	Decentralization: this Surowiecky’s term for what we have called “division of labor”: people should as much as possible be able to gather and process their information in parallel, so that they can together cover an as wide range of aspects as possible.•	Aggregation: collective intelligence requires an effective mechanism, such as voting, averaging or discussion, for synthesizing a diversity of individual opinions into a single, collective answer.


To shift from individual intelligence to collective intelligence, we need to make intentionality collective as well [Heylighen, Heath & Van Overwalle, 2004]. Words and other symbols can only be used for effective communication if the conversation partners understand them in the same way, that is if they agree about wat the word refers to. Developing such shared references is a problem of what we have called alignment.
