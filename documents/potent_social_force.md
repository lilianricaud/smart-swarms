**Globalized rootless identity is arguably the most potent social force of our times.**

Ironically, it supersedes traditional religion in much of the world. Once they adopt alien images as an essential part of a falsely progressive worldview, people will cling to them desperately, as if their lives depend upon them.

Selling a building purely as alien image perverts social conscience, yet the population is manipulated to enthusiastically support this practice. The majority wants these alien images, and is ashamed of its own evolved
identity. Nevertheless, the price paid for adopting a new, rootless identity is that people lose their humanity. Enticed by the immense power of globalization, they sever their biological and socio-cultural roots — they don’t know who they are, or even if they are part of nature.


Clients for high-profile architecture belong to (or desperately wish to join) this rootless global society. Intellectuals support this shift, because they continue to follow the discredited dogmas of outdated revolutionary movements, which swore to extinguish traditional cultures. The media praise instead of condemning a radical
transformation of evolved architectural identity into contextless image linked to power.
Journalists and critics ignorant of living qualities in architecture speak with misleading authority and certainty. The touted ―economic development‖ is unfortunately limited to the financial gains of a global élite and its local collaborators.

In architecture schools, the overwhelming concern is to produce novelty linked to Contemporary Art (which is incompatible with Traditional Art as humanity’s evolved creative achievement). This is either mixed up with dogmatic obedience to minimalism, or it is driven by the desire to inject complexity into design — without, however,
understanding the mathematics of complexity. 

**Such innovation is strictly image-based.**

Our educational system worldwide surrendered itself to cult ideologues who teach our children that modernity requires the extinguishing of socio-cultural identity (Agbo,2018; Córdova-Ramírez, 2017; Michl, 2014). That what we inherited from the past is not only worthless — but it is an impediment to progress.


Efforts to re-establish evolved architectural identity While global industry is ruthless in pursuing profits, it has no clear ideological agenda. A separate segment within our society is driven to erase cultural identity, as it
convinces real-estate speculators to make money through implementing this nihilistic ideal. 

**There is no reason for such a coupling between economics and ideology, however, since profits can be made building in any variety of styles. And yet, we see architectural nihilism as the preferred tool of globalization.** One senses an intolerant
religious zeal behind the desire to destroy the identity contained in our past — cultural genocide practiced against the life embedded in architectural and urban forms.
