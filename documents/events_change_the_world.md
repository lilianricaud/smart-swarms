Jay Cousins: "Events change the world. They act as catalysts for Social and Cultural Transformation.

Events can bring about profound behavioral and organisational changes. If you ask someone to make a permanent change in behavior they will resist. But, if you ask for them to try something out for 5 minutes, an hour, a day, or a week then the change is less threatening. Itâ€™s a taster, more acceptable. It then allows people to make an informed choice, rather than one based on their fears.


No change is ever permanent, however one which is explicitly temporary is much easier to instigate. Events allow you to prototype the new in the short term, so you can create lasting and sustainable change in the long term. Events change the world. They act as catalysts for Social and Cultural Transformation.
