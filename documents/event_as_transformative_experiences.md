Co-creative events patterns could be designed to behave as a kind of “Temporary Autonomous Zone” with their own sets of rules, that differ from everyday reality. In that perspective, they could be used a culture hacking tool.

A Common language and a map of existing co-creative event glocal communities could facilitate swarm aggregation of networked individuals around common goals and format.
