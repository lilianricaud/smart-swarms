AN ECOLOGY FOR TRANSFORMATIVE ACTION

+ annotations


Accumulated wealth pro- vides the leverage and the means to invest massively on simplified or false memes that make more complex memes difficult to convey and grasp, and keep it that way. Memes that favour the status quo and the self-mul- tiplication and self-reinforcement of self-multiplying self-reinforcing loops are the ones that win in a race to the bottom among politicians. 

The potential for continuous widespread disruptive innovation and radical change rests in the field of change agents or activists who are actively engaged and are taking things into their hands. The legions of realistic optimists of all types of backgrounds who per- ceive current dangers and the need for systemic change, even when they don’t really know what needs to be done and how they can get involved. These are the ones who need to be inspired, empowered and enabled. They observe and are aware of where the world is going and they have the capacity to apply changes on the
ground everyday.

Active realistic optimists prefer not to assume that solutions will emerge on their own, neither do they consider the perspective of a total breakdown as a negligible remote probability.

French philosopher Jean Pierre Dupuy’s ‘enlightened doomsaying’ approach, suggests that holding the possibility of a catastrophe credible enables us to become more proactive and to chose, among all options available, those that will in the end
push the catastrophe away or make it acceptable...
The challenge is to leverage agency and the capacity for humans to engage and act wherever they may find themselves, in a way which can cohesively steer the system in a new direction to avoid the worst.

AN ECOLOGY FOR TRANSFORMATIVE ACTION
The legions of change agents already busy intervening on a variety of leverage points or ready to be mobilized form an ecology for transformative action, with its multiple niches and clusters, adap- tive and generative processes, patterns of relation- ships, and capacities for co-evolution. They are distributed within the wider system where they have the potential to drive systemic change and human development. The critical point is for these distributed and locally organized efforts to coalesce in order to change the feedbacks and information structures of the system and its capacity for renewal so that the system can
take care of itself in a healthy way


In Changing Image of Man (Marley 1982), a team of researchers from Stanford University established that cultural transformations historically occurred with the presence of a strong image to embody change and crystallize imagination and action toward new visions of the world. They suggested that such informing image would need to provide a holistic sense and perspective on life, entail an ecological ethic, entail a self-realization ethic, be multileveled, multifaceted, and integrative, lead to a balancing and coordinating satisfactions along many dimensions, be experimental and open-ended. This describes well the characteristics of an ecology from which transformative action and a transformative image can emerge, as well as the commons logic itself.

Looking at the universe of possibilities for intervention and innovation as an ecology for transformative action (Finidori 2012) enables to envision change and problem solving not as a transcendent, centralized or controllable process that encompasses sets of critical and prioritized components and leverage points into one master plan or framework, but as an immanent distributed self-directed one composed of myriads of initiatives, master plans and frameworks that complement each other.

A commons logic based pattern language as scaffold

Architect Ann Pendleton-Jullian describes ecosystems of change as scaffold to aggregate the different kinds of powers and mechanisms that are out there, and support the emergence of the new until it becomes strong enough to affect power structures. She suggests a new type of metanarrative. Something strategically ambiguous towards which to head despite our differences, and that can draw coherence from a variety of disparate micro narratives that shape events and build trust at the grassroots level.

For process philosopher Bonnitta Roy, the unifying principle or metanarrative would need to increase the diversity of the system. It must not try to transcend and resolve differences, but it must preserve and add to them. The unifying principle would be underlying, not overarching, and act an undertow for transformative action.

A pattern language integrating the various dimensions of the commons logic would provide an architecture of participation oriented towards participatory clarity, and help learners and change agents in various communities of practice compose the solutions to theirs needs in a more interconnected and effective way. Such pattern language would be conceived around the elements that shape the various engagement logics and clusters of engagement and would help people in various clusters navigate the space of possibilities in self or group discovery journeys in ways that resonates with their own engagement logic, to discover the unknown and expand the boundaries of their understanding and action.

The pattern language would provision the conditions for the commons to thrive in the form of building blocks that will enable change agents to create solutions and organize action in the contexts they are engaged in, while keeping aware of the diversity of possibilities around. These building blocks would focus on leverage points in the system that can help break the patterns of the current economy, those which are devastating to the commons in all their forms, and that can instill instead patterns that are protective and generative of commons.

This is what the pattern language is set to do at the systems level. Allow each paradigm to coexist with the others, without requiring paradigms to be changed a priori or as a goal, without requiring anyone to ‘fit him/herself in other worldviews.

We will be looking at which 'pairs' of patterns can help optimize each other, and at incorporating in our patterns some heuristics to explore the points at which a pattern can become an anti-pattern.

Centers as essence of life
One can refer to idea of "centers" (Alexander 2002) as the 'why/what for' determinant of the attributes of a design and from there relate to the notion of "pattern". Centers are the essence of life. "Patterns" are combined in 'generative sequences' to create/(re)design better "centers."
Patterns are not only problem solving principles (Alexander 1977), but they are also systems- structuring and generative elements with their own feedback loops that can be applied at various levels and scales as things are unfolding, enabling to go from liquid to solid, the diversity of which creates a
resilient 'structure' that is generated both in a constructed and in an emergent way.


These centers are constitutive of commons health and protection, designed or 'constructed' not as representation of a desired social order, but as generative systems. And the patterns, assembled for each center/social object according to its own internal drive or engagement logic would be aimed at 'bettering' the commons in whole or in part in all its forms and dimensions.

So in practical terms, the patterns we envision are not prescriptive of solutions, they are prescriptive of generative principles, mechanisms, and inquiry processes and they orient retrieval of information and decision making towards specific systemic effects (re)generative of the commons.


Re-focusing the goal of the system from the accu- mulation of capital and other factors of production to the abundance of commons as factors of opportu- nities and regeneration for the thrivability and renewal of the system could serve as a medium for accelerat- ing the adoption of practices that address social, envi- ronmental and economic dimensions in a sustainable,
cohesive and interconnected manner.
