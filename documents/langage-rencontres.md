Il nous manque un vocabulaire commun en tant que groupe pour nous entendre sur des rencontres et des façons de travailler.

Un langage des rencontres et du faire ensemble:

Minga Lingua

une langue du travailler ensemble pour le bien commun
un travail commun pour créer une langue

langage dans le sens pattern language: combiner des patterns pour faire système complexe

Langage qui permet de partager une intention au sein d'un groupe

Implicitly embedded values

Language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefit of cooperation, reaching agreement, striking deals coordinating activities.

Specialists in every branch of knowledge develop a particular vocabulary that enables them to communicate efficiently amongst themselves. Theadvantage in developing a specialised language is that of conciseness. Expressing a complex, multi faceted construct in a single word is usually preferable to using everyday language for either of the following reasons. First, an explicit, unequivocal decription of the contruct in everyday language would be so long as to be unwieldy. Second, it may not even exist because the construct encompasses tacit knowledge that is only shared through common experience (ref p6).

Language common to people who share a specialisation enables them to build effectively upon a foundation of shared understanding. (p7)

ontology (="knowledge hubs": explicit specification of a conceptualisation in the form of named concepts, instances, relations and axioms. Together these constitute a statement of a logical theory that represents a body of knowledge.

Criteria for body of knowledge as an attractor: Visibility, user-friendliness and continued relevance. p69

body of knowledge as community glue holding the participants together. It becomes a shared resource whose integrity participants care about. (…) Cohesion, the ability to reach consensus within the group, determines the amount of conflict that will be observed. All other things being equal, a community with a high degree of cohesion will grow its ranks and its knowledge repository faster than one that doesn't have it. However too little diversity is likely to result in intllectual stagnation. For the growth of knowledge it is thus ncessary to remain between the extremes of chaos and uniformity. a commitment to achieving cohesion can arise when the participants believe that they will benefit from building an intellectual common ground more than if they did not collaborate.p70-71

It is often debated whether words encapsulating conceptual categories such as poslots "reflect" or "shape" ways of thinking, but the debate seems misonceived: clearly they do both.
(…)
Culture-specific words are conceptual tools that reflect a society's past experience of doing and thinking about things in certain ways. As a society changes, these tools, too, may be gradually modified and discarded. In that sense, the outlook of a society is never wholly "determined" by its stock of conceptual tools, but it is clearly influenced by them. 

Similarly, the outlook of an individual is never fully "determined" by the conceptual tools provided by his or her native language, partly because there are always alternative ways of expressing oneself. But a person's conceptual perspective on life is clearly influenced by his or her native language.

To people with an intimate knowledge of two (or more) different languages and cultures, it is usually self-evident that language and patterns of thought are interlinked (cf. Hunt & Benaji 1988).

Words are the tools of thought, and you will often find that you are thinking badly because you are using the wrong tools, trying to bore a hole with a screw-driver, or draw a cork with a coal-hammer. 
—A. P. Herbert, British politician and writer, What a Word!, 1935

Language is a way cultures map their world. However the map is not the territory and each language has its way of mapping things which are relevant to them.

reaction to marc pagel video:

Different languages = barrier to cooperation, restrict cooperation to smaller cooperative groups. However, the barrier is semi-permeable like membranes and other interfaces in biological systems.


Different languages = different realities, a society living in a forest might have hundreds of words to describes every possible shades of green, various sounds and other things significants to them, whereas a biologist might have words for realities, concepts, object relevant to living systems he studies. A common language helps large scale cooperation, however having small specialized cooperative groups allow specialized cooperation more adapted to a given context.

culture is a system of shared meanings and symbols

Culture in the sociological field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, non-material culture or material culture.

En sociologie, la culture est définie comme "ce qui est commun à un groupe d'individus" et comme "ce qui le soude". Ainsi, pour une institution internationale comme l'UNESCO : « Dans son sens le plus large, la culture peut aujourd'hui être considérée comme l'ensemble des traits distinctifs, spirituels et matériels, intellectuels et affectifs, qui caractérisent une société ou un groupe social. Elle englobe, outre les arts et les lettres, les modes de vie, les droits fondamentaux de l'être humain, les systèmes de valeurs, les traditions et les croyances. »1 Ce "réservoir commun" évolue dans le temps par et dans les formes des échanges. Il se constitue en manières distinctes d'être, de penser, d'agir et de communiquer.
