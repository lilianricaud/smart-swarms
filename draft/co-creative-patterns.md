# CO-CREATIVE PATTERNS 

for smart mobs, co-creative swarms

## EMPOWERMENT
 Adequate elbow room – also known generically as ‘empowerment’


## CONTINUOUS LEARNING 

Lear and improve as you go, keep learning, keep improving.

## VARIETY

An optimal level of variety – conscious avoidance of boredom or meaningless repetition

## MUTUAL SUPPORT AND RESPECT
Mutual support and respect – reciprocating, giving and getting help

## MEANINGFULNESS

Meaningfulness – a clear sense that what one is doing is useful and aligned with personal values to an appropriate degree

## DESIRABLE FUTURE

A desirable future – people usually don’t want to invest time and energy in dead-end work

## RADICAL NON VIOLENCE

In a system that is based on war, control and domination, using violence is like throwing fuel to a fire, it doesn't help and only help make it stronger and backfires. Any attempt to change things will have to invent new ways of resisting violence using non-violent techniques.

## GENERATIVITY

Interesting article about the concept of "generativity" and "generative organizations" by Cv Harquail (<a href="https://twitter.com/cvharquail">@cvharquail</a>). I believe the best co-creative events are temporary "<strong>generative organizations</strong>" allowing emergence of great outcomes, even though we might "<em>not know and can’t predict specifically what a generative behavior will trigger</em>".<!--more-->

Excerpts:
<blockquote>The word ‘generative’ may be unfamiliar to many managers, but the quality of generativity is something we’ve sought in our work practices and systems for a long time.

Something is “generative” when it’s able to originate or produce something, or to give rise to new possibilities.

Generative ideas produce new ideas,

Generative process produces new ways of doing things or new outcomes,

Generative learning enhances our ability to create,

Generative relationships build new capabilities in both partners, and

Generative leadership helps others see opportunity in their actions.

Generative practices are important because they make new things possible. They have the capacity for ‘more’ built right in.

Generative practices make new opportunities possible, but not inevitable. We don’t know and can’t predict specifically what a generative behavior will trigger. We can only expect these practices to create openings and invite new outcomes to emerge.

We also can’t control what others do with the generativity that we put into our behavior towards them. Just as when we invite people to a party and we can’t control if or how they’ll rsvp, we can’t control what people or organizations do with the generative behaviors we extend.</blockquote>

## SOCIAL OBJECT

Discovered via Lyre Calliope (<a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainCalliope">@CaptainCalliope</a>), here's another interesting concept:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_objects">Social Objects</a> which wikipedia defines as objects around which <a class="mw-redirect" title="Social networks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networks">social networks</a> form. <!--more-->

Excerpt from: <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/2007/12/31/social-objects-for-beginners/">Social Objects for beginners</a>
<blockquote>The Social Object, in a nutshell, is the reason two people are talking to each other, as opposed to talking to somebody else. Human beings are social animals. We like to socialize. But if think about it, there needs to be a reason for it to happen in the first place. That reason, that “node” in the social network, is what we call the Social Object.

I'm thinking Co-creative events can be used as social object, creating their own social network, whether temporarily around a particular gathering, or sometime so successfully they lead to a global event-centered communities (see for example the <a title="Barcamp" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/barcamp/">Barcamp</a> or <a title="PARK(ing) Day" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/parking-day/">Park(ing) Day</a>)
